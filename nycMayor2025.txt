<h3>Election day was about 2 days ago, and a-lot happened</h3><br>
<h4 style="font-family: Space Grotesk">While much more than 3 elections occured, the nation seemed captivated on 3 in particular: NYC Mayoral Elections, New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections, and Virginia Gubernatorial Elections. Democrats won or are projected to win across the board. I want to, in this blog post, explore the NYC Mayoral Elections, share my opinions, and explore the subject further.</h4><br>

<h3>Politics isn't a light topic.</h3><br>
<h4 style="font-family: Space Grotesk">If politics was a black and white issue, a good vs. evil, there would be little debate (or constructive/noteworthy debate that is). That's not the case. Too often do we ignore the nuance of our political system today.</h4><br>
<h4 style="font-family: Space Grotesk">If you didn't come here to read my political opinions, that's okay. It doesn't mean you have to leave, unless you don't want to read anything about politics whatsoever that is. The point of an essay, and this blog post, is not to assert or make a claim. As of writing this very paragraph, I don't know everything surrounding the subject. What I do know is that I have my opinions, and there's a decent chance that you have yours. If I write this sucessfully, by the end of reading this we can all come to a greater general understanding of the nuance behind this year's mayoral election, even if our opinions don't outright change. There is no <i>"right answer"</i> to this election.</h4><br>

<h3>New York is a city built on Trump's shoulders.</h3><br>
<h4 style="font-family: Space Grotesk"></h4><br>

<h3>The cost of living is an unavoidable issue.</h3><br>
<h4 style="font-family: Space Grotesk"></h4><br>

<h3>There's more nuance to Andrew Cuomo.</h3><br>
<h4 style="font-family: Space Grotesk"></h4><br>

<h3>The cost of living is an unavoidable issue; however, so is "Trump-proofing" New York.</h3>
<h4 style="font-family: Space Grotesk"></h4><br>

<h3>I would argue that there are no winners to this election.</h3><br>
<h4 style="font-family: Space Grotesk"></h4><br>

<h3>We as a society are exceptional at learning our history, and spectacularly awful at applying the lessons of it.</h3><br>
<h4 style="font-family: Space Grotesk"></h4><br>

<h3>I'm a New Yorker. Now, I'm also more scared than ever.</h3><br>
<h4 style="font-family: Space Grotesk"></h4><br><br>

<h3>So, to conclude: Congrats New York, you voted Mamdani. Now, are you ready for the occupation?</h3><br>
