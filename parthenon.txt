<h3>Hey there!</h3><br>
<h4 style="font-family: Space Grotesk">Welcome to the live blog post for <a href="https://parthenon.hackclub.com" style="color: rgb(225, 148, 228)">Parthenon</a>! (If it isn't live, that's because Parthenon is over now)</h4><br>
<h4 style="font-family: Space Grotesk">By the end of each day of Parthenon - 3 days total - I'll be providing 1-2 updates on the event, our project, and overall vibes ^w^</h4><br>

<h3>Day 1: Friday</h3><br>
<h5 style="font-family: Space Grotesk">(I'm writing this at 2:10 AM. Not too tired; however, tired enough.)</h5><br>
<h4 style="font-family: Space Grotesk">Day 1 went well! I ate some Chipotle, tried interior designing, met up with some friends for the first time, voted for the <a href="htps://parliament.hcgov.uk" style="color: rgb(225, 148, 228)">Parliament</a> elections, finalized our idea, and handed out some posters<h4><br>

<h5 style="font-family: Space Grotesk">Got some pretty cool views of the Empire State Building on the way into the city, since I took the train instead of the Metro North; however, this is the photo that I got</h5><br>
<h4 style="font-family: Space Grotesk">By the time I arrived at Civic Hall, everyone had already gone to Duolingo HQ for the kickoff. Instead, I stayed behind with some of the staff and those that also arrived after, and we worked on decorating the entire venue! I put down most of the twine and all of the candles on the tables, and helped with some of the tableclothes. I tried balloons; however, they cut off circulation to my finger when tying them together which scared me.<h4><br>

<h4 style="font-family: Space Grotesk">After we finished decorating, we ate the Chipotle food we had ordered (which was probably better in terms of what I prefer compared to what was at Duolingo). Before the masses from the Duolingo kick-off arrived, we had a pretty chill circle near the big window that overlooks the (I think?) Chrysler Building. Tongyu was there along with some other people I got to know<h4><br><br>
<h4 style="font-family: Space Grotesk">After a bit, I was able to meet up with my team! A big difference between Daydream and Parthenon is that I've known these people for a long time; however, I've never met them in-person. With Daydream, I knew them for much less time; however, we always got on voice calls and it wasn't a huge shock when I got there.<h4><br>

<h4 style="font-family: Space Grotesk">I'm about to go to sleep now; however, we've put together our plan and plan to pitch it tomorrow!<h4><br>
