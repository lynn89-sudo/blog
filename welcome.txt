<h3>Welcome to my blog! As of writing this, I'm actually not done; this is supposed to be a test entry. However, that doesn't mean we can't make something out of this ^w^</h3>

</h3>
<h3>When <a href='https://rss.hackclub.com">Hack Club's RSS YSWS</a> launched, I was first introduced to the concept of RSS. For a while now, I've always been finding very convoluted ways to create static APIs and dynamic features on websites.</h3>
<h4>More coming soon...</h4>
