<h3>Hi there!</h3><br>
<h5 style="font-family: Space Grotesk" >Welcome to my first blog post! This post was originally intended as a development example to test the site itself; however, that doesn't mean we can't actually make a blog post ^w^</h5><br>

<h3>This blog, along with the entire site, is built statically on SvelteKit and hosted on Github Pages.</h3><br>
<h5 style="font-family: Space Grotesk">The blog itself is run with SvelteKit and <a style="color: rgb(225, 148, 228)" href="https://hackclub.app">Hack Club Nest</a>. Nest is a virtual server that hosts the RSS feed for updating and indexing new blog posts.</h5><br>
<h5 style="font-family: Space Grotesk">The RSS feed contains meta information (ie. title, description, link), along with a link to the GitHub repository that contains the text document for the actual contents of the article itself.</h5><br>
<h5 style="font-family: Space Grotesk">The Github contains HTML content in text form, that the website imports and converts into raw HTML. The downside of this is that trying to keep styling consistent and readable isn't easy, and requires me to add inline styling on the text document itself where needed.</h5><br>

<h3>While some aspects of making this website pushed me to my limits, making this blog forced me to surpass my limits</h3><br>
<h5 style="font-family: Space Grotesk">It took a really long time to get this site to a point where I was proud of it, from a design aspect that is. I started out with so many cool ideas; while I hope to implement them one day, I realized that for making this website I would need to make something much quicker. I was able to learn how animated SVG paths work in Svelte and how to use sticky divs (positioning)</h5><br>
<h5 style="Space Grotesk">Before starting on this blog, I had to actually learn how Nest worked. I created my Nest account a <i>very</i> long time ago; however, I was too intimidated to actually do something with it. While setting up an RSS feed isn't the not ambitious thing you can do with a server, I'm proud of taking the time to finally learn how to setup stuff on Nest</h5><br><br>
<h3>Thanks for reading!</h3>
